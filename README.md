# VitalTrack: A Health Management System

## Overview
- VitalTrack is a CRUD based health management system. The main objective of this project is to replace the traditional paper pen registration, with a digitalised system that stores, retrieve and visualize the paitents data
## Features
- **CRUD BASED PATIENT MANAGEMENT:** This allows the user to add a new paitent by entering their ID, NAME and some more personal details like, AGE, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND ALLERGIES IF ANY
- **HISTORY TRACKER:** This allows the user to view all the past records and search paitents with certain medical conditions, for example to retrieve the paitents suffering from diabetes, the user can just choose that option, type the name of the medical condition and the system would give back the paitents with that condition
- **Auto Save:** All the userinfo is saved as a csv file and data is stored safely
- **DELETION OF ID:** This allows the user to simply delete unwanted entries
- **RED ALERT SYSTEM:** If a paitents entered suffer from some serious conditions, the code automatically highlights it and gives back a red alert system to warn the user about the serious illness
- **VISUALIZATION:** This creates a bar chart showing weight of all paitents to compare them visually

## Technology 
- **Language:** Python
- **VS CODE:** Editor
- **CSV:** File format to save the data
- **MatPlotLib:** To draw graph
## Steps to install & run the project
